## TenK10 analyses 
TenK10K phase 1 is the first phase of TenK10K, which aims to collect scRNA-seq data from up to 10,000 (PBM) cells from approximately 10,000 people.

The full dataset will include:
* 5,000 "healthy" individuals, extending the current OneK1K cohort [1]
* 2,000 heart disease individuals from the BioHEART cohort [2]

Phase 1 includes the current OneK1K and BioHEART, for 2,500-3,000 total people.

Scripts and notebooks for analyses of the TenK10K datasets on Garvan's HPC system.
