## The TenK10 cohort
TenK10K phase 1 is the first phase of TenK10K, which aims to collect scRNA-seq data from up to 10,000 (PBM) cells from approximately 10,000 people.

The full dataset will include:
* 5,000 "healthy" individuals, extending the current OneK1K cohort [1]
* 2,000 heart disease individuals from the BioHEART cohort [2]
* 1,500 pan-cancer cohort (LBIO [3])
* 1,000 pan-autoimmune disease cohort (AIM [4])
* 600 long COVID cohort (ADAPT [5])

### Phase 1

Phase 1 includes the current OneK1K and BioHEART, for ~2,000 total people (~1,000 OneK1K individuals, ~1,000 BioHEART individuals).
scRNA-seq was re-generated with a new kit, aiming at ~5,000 cells per individual.
For these ~2,000 individuals, matched whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data was collected also.

### Analyses: Rare variant association with single-cell expression

Scripts and notebooks for analyses of the TenK10K datasets on Garvan's high performance computing (HPC) system and on the CPG's Google Cloud Performance computing (GCP) - with some of the latter also [here](https://github.com/populationgenomics/tob-wgs/tree/get-variants/scripts/rv_expression_association).
